# OpenPBR Surface parameters (exact)

This table holds the 36 of the specification's 41 parameters that vork shades, with the specification's
identifiers, types, ranges and defaults. All are std/openpbr material inputs. The other five (base_diffuse_roughness,
transmission_scatter, transmission_scatter_anisotropy, coat_roughness_anisotropy, geometry_coat_tangent) are neither inputs nor Closure fields.
No aliases. The std-only evaluation input below is excluded from Closure. Range: `[]` inclusive, `()` exclusive, per channel for colours and vectors. Norm is the
typically useful range where it differs from the allowed range (a soft range, not a clamp). Lengths other than
`thin_film_thickness` are in scene world units (metres in vork). `color3` is linear in the model colour space (OpenPBR
default ACEScg; vork uses linear Rec.709, see [colour](../../docs/help/materials.md)).

The binding-restriction column records the supported table-input subset; an empty cell uses the type's ordinary bindings.

Spec-text notes (copied as the reference table gives them):
- `subsurface_color` range is written `[0, 1]` (no ³) although its type is color3; read it per channel.
- Not in OpenPBR, so not vork material inputs: `emission_strength`, `sheen_*`, `clearcoat_*`, `specular_anisotropy`,
  `specular_rotation`, `subsurface_scale`, `coat_normal`, `coat_affect_*`, `geometry_thickness`,
  `double_sided`, displacement.

| **Dispersion** | | | | | | | |
| `transmission_dispersion_scale` | float | [0, 1] | | 0 | | Linearly scales the amount of dispersion | |
| `transmission_dispersion_abbe_number` | float | (0, ∞) | [9, 91] | 20 | | Physical Abbe number of the base dielectric medium | |

Std evaluation input (not an OpenPBR Closure field):

| `alpha_cutoff` | float | [-1, 1] | | -1 | | Negative disables threshold; otherwise geometry_opacity >= alpha_cutoff produces 1, else 0 | Input only |
