//! Install-time frame graph. Passes declare the named resources they read and
//! write, in execution order; `Graph::new` drops passes the plan does not run or
//! whose writes reach no sink (the view colour, and CPU readback when the install
//! reads pixels back), and rejects a read of a produced resource before its writer. The compiled graph is
//! a flat step list with one run bit per step: a frame sets the bits from its
//! values and walks the list. No names, hashing or allocation exist per frame.
//!
//! Transients are backed once per installed scene and shared by every frame
//! slot: one queue executes slot submissions in order, and `Transients::submit`
//! keeps each frame's samples contiguous. Within a frame, one backing serves
//! several names whose step intervals are disjoint and whose descriptors are
//! identical (wgpu cannot place two resources in one allocation).
//!
//! Each view records its steps once, when it is created: pass modules build
//! their bind groups and dispatches and hand compute work to a `Recorder`;
//! `Graph::record` orders it with the raster and frame passes.
//!
//! To add a pass: add a `Pass` variant, declare it in `declare` at its place in
//! the order with its reads, writes, install condition and run bit, then record
//! its compute work with `Recorder::compute` (post passes; also list it in
//! `Pass::is_compute`), or encode it in `encode_view` (raster) or
//! `FrameSlot::encode_sample` (frame passes).
