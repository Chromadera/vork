# GPU frames to video

Unstable, internal Rust crate; everything in it is free to change.

Rust package `vork-encode`.
`Encoder::open(DeviceInfo { device, queue, backend }, width, height, fps, EncodeSettings::default(), path, ring_depth)`,
`create_surface() -> Surface`, `push(index, texture, &mut surface)`, `release(index, &mut surface)`,
`finish() -> PathBuf`. Errors use `anyhow::Result`.

`Encoder::prepare(backend, width, height, fps, settings, path) -> PreparedEncoder`
creates device-independent codec resources without creating or truncating the output.
It may run on a worker while the render device starts. `PreparedEncoder::open(device,
queue, ring_depth)` validates device limits, creates the output and attaches GPU resources.
Dropping a preparation without opening it cancels and reclaims its native session,
leaving an existing output untouched. On Linux, driver loading and CUDA initialization
run in prepare; context creation, Vulkan UUID matching and NVENC attachment remain in open.

Frames start at zero and must arrive in order; duplicate and future indices fail explicitly.
Install one `Surface` per graph ring entry and output. Record `surface.record_copy` after the
frame's resolve, submit on the supplied queue, then call `push`. Before reusing an entry,
call `release` to wait for its pipe write or native encode/file consumer. The graph also waits
for PNG/EXR consumers before resubmitting the entry. Surface storage is never replaced at collection.
Input is single-sample 2D RGBA8Unorm
or BGRA8Unorm, even dimensions, COPY_SRC usage; native Metal also requires TEXTURE_BINDING.
Texture values represent encoded sRGB components; do not supply linear-light colour values.

* macOS Auto: wgpu-hal Metal texture handle -> GPU compute conversion -> IOSurface-backed
  BGRA CVPixelBuffer -> one hardware-required VideoToolbox session -> AVAssetWriter passthrough
  MP4 mux. No CPU pixel readback. The renderer writes directly to installed BGRA IOSurfaces when supported;
  other sources use GPU conversion into the entry surface. CoreVideo retains the installed
  surfaces, and ring release waits through compression and file consumption.
  Rec.709 matrix/primaries/transfer are explicit. Metal completion hands off asynchronously.
* Linux Auto: wgpu Vulkan texture -> device-local, dedicated exportable buffer -> opaque fd
  imported into CUDA on the matching Vulkan device UUID -> one NVENC session. NVENC accepts
  RGBA/BGRA and performs its RGB-to-YUV conversion. No CPU pixel readback. Only compressed
  H.264 is piped through ffmpeg for MP4 muxing (`-c:v copy`). Export/import and resource
  registration happen once per slot. Input/bitstream capacity comes from the graph ring depth; each entry is drained in order
  before reuse, and finish
  drains the remaining slots. Vulkan ownership barriers cover each slot’s buffer range.
  Stage totals for copy/wait, NVENC submit/drain and mux writes/finish are printed at finish.
  If native initialization is unavailable, fall back to the previous readback NVENC/libx264 path.
  `uses_pixel_readback()` reports which path opened; failures after the first frame are errors.
* Readback: the ring entry’s padded staging buffer -> libx264 through ffmpeg on every platform.
* HardwareReadback: readback -> ffmpeg VideoToolbox (Mac) or NVENC (Linux), for measurement.

Linux MP4 muxing and portable fallback require ffmpeg on PATH (libx264 for software encoding).
Before opening a readback stream on any platform, the selected encoder must appear in
ffmpeg’s video encoder list; missing codecs fail with the portable encoding dependency
message before writing pixels or touching the destination.
Native Linux loads libcuda.so.1 and libnvidia-encode.so.1 dynamically; no CUDA SDK is needed
to build. Native macOS needs no ffmpeg for encoding.
Hardware initialization errors can be handled by reopening with Readback. `finish` flushes hardware
callbacks before finalizing the mux. It borrows the encoder and closes frame submission;
GPU/native resources stay owned until the encoder is dropped. Retaining finished encoders
allows a one-shot process to exit after flushing its files without redundant driver teardown.
Drop hardware encoders before `std::process::exit`/libc `exit`; only `_exit` may
skip the drop without running driver exit hooks. Dropping an unfinished encoder
cancels it/reaps its child.
MP4 container bytes may include session metadata; determinism checks compare decoded framemd5.

## Encode policy

`EncodeSettings` selects the codec; H.264 is the implemented format.
Defaults preserve 12 Mbps hardware VBR, a two-second GOP and software libx264 CRF 18
with the `veryfast` preset. Callers can change bitrate, GOP seconds and software CRF;
all backends receive the same GOP, and native hardware receives the selected bitrate.
Hardware bitrate and software CRF are deliberately different rate-control modes.

Render concurrency (`vork_render::FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT`) bounds active GPU submissions. The
output ring has three entries per active frame: one GPU flight and two consumer flights.
PNG, EXR, portable video and native encoder surfaces share entry lifetimes; the encoder has
no independent reorder queue, staging recycler or surface-capacity policy.

All video outputs use limited-range Rec.709 YUV with matching matrix, primaries
and transfer tags on native VideoToolbox/NVENC and readback ffmpeg. The ffmpeg path explicitly converts RGB to limited-range BT.709
YUV before encoding, so its conversion agrees with the stream metadata.

MOV destinations select ProRes 4444 (full chroma plus alpha). Auto uses a native
VideoToolbox session and IOSurfaces on Mac, preferring hardware and allowing
Apple’s software encoder. VT initialization failure falls back to `prores_ks`
CPU readback, also used on Linux and Windows. Software ProRes automatically selects slice workers from available CPUs. An ordered pipe worker
overlaps pipe writes with rendering/readback; finish drains the worker before waiting for
the muxer. Each ring entry owns its CPU payload and gets it back on release; a bounded stderr
tail is included in failures.
`HardwareReadback` with MOV is rejected; use Auto or Readback. MP4 retains the
existing H.264 hardware path and cannot carry alpha. The renderer supplies straight RGBA when `render.background` is `"transparent"`.

The ordering test checks BT.709 tags and decodes with explicit BT.709/video range.
On Mac, set `VORK_REQUIRE_VT_PRORES=1` for that test to require Auto MOV to use
VideoToolbox (no pixel readback); without it, Auto may legitimately fall back.
